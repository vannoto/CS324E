// PROJECT DESCRIPTION //

This project utilizes a python script to extract all the words found in the novel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and exports them into a .txt file (allwords.txt). That .txt file is subsequently used to generate more .txt files containing: all the unique words in the novel (uniquewords.txt), and key-value pairs of: the number of times a word appears and how many words appear that many times (wordfrequency.txt). 

Using uniquewords.txt, a3_novelvisualization.pde generates a "word cloud" containing as many words that can fit in the canvas. We found that close to 50 words is optimal so that they do not run off of the canvas. We chose colors such as reds, oranges, browns, and warm greens to exemplify the rustic themes of the novel. The font "Old Press" downloaded from dafont.com was used to further carry the aforementioned aesthetics. Random text sizes were used to add variety to the word cloud, with careful consideration of the size of the canvas. 

using wordfrequency.txt,a3_wordfrequency.pde generates a picture that shows the relationship between word frequency and numbers of words. The width of each rectangle represents the number of words of that frequency. The rectangles distribute left and right, which make it looks symmetric. The colour turns from red to white with the number of words decreasing.
