1. Make sure that a .txt file of the novel of interest (in our case, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer labeled Tom.txt) is in the same directory as extract_words.py.

2. Open and run extract_words.py. Three text files will result in the directory: allwords.txt containing all words in the text, uniquewords.txt containing all unique words in the text, and wordfrequency containing key-value pairs of the number of words that appear and the specific number of times.

3. Open the a3_novelvisualization directory, and make sure that the desired .ttf or .otf font file (Old Press.ttf), desired background image (Paper.jpg), and uniquewords.txt are there along with a3_novelvisualization.pde.

4. Run a3_novelvisualization.pde and generate the word cloud. Press the spacebar to generate a new word cloud.

5. Open the a3_wordfrequency directory, and make sure that wordfrequency.txt is there along with a3_wordfrequency.pde.

6. Run a3_wordfrequency.pde and generate a visualization of the word frequency.
